## Computing the minimum detour distance between four points

From the problem spec:

> Calculate the detour distance between two different rides. Given four latitude / longitude pairs, where driver one is traveling from point A to point B and driver two is traveling from point C to point D, write a function (in your language of choice) to calculate the shorter of the detour distances the drivers would need to take to pick-up and drop-off the other driver.

In other words, the detour distance is the extra distance a driver would make if she were going from point X to point Y and had to stop at points U and W along the way. Here, one driver is going from A to B and another is going from C to D. So the minimum detour distance is the minimum of ACDB - AB and CABD - CD.

The solution is a Ruby script that uses the Bing Routes API to compute the distance between four coordinates.

Usage:

1. Obtain a Bing Maps API key (instructions [here][1]) and save it to `config/key.txt`
2. Look up the coordinates of the area you're interested in (for example, [here][2]). The below example computes the minimum detour distance between Seattle, Sunnyvale, Austin, and NYC.
3. Plug them into the script (note no space between the latitude and longitude):

        > ruby dist_calc.rb -A 47.606209,-122.332071 -B 37.368830,-122.03635 -C 30.267153,-97.743061 -D 40.714353,-74.005973
        Calculating...
        The minimum detour distance is 4071.85 mi.

If the coordinates are all reachable, the script prints out the minimum detour distance in miles and exits with 0. If the coordinates aren't reachable, or there is a problem communicating with the routing server, or the API key is invalid, the script prints out an error message and exits with a non-zero status code.
